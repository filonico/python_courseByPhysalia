    "> As we have seen today there are many (many!) ways to approach any dataset. First consider a question that you want to test from this data. If you are more interested in statistical testing then you can focus on the metadata and statistics with pandas/scipy. If you are more interested in sequence bioinformatics then you can work with the fasta data. However you'll likely need both to fully investigate.\n",
