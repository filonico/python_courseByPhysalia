# README
In this repository you will find a collection of excercises that I have executed for the course "**Introduction to Python programming for biologists**" by [Physalia](https://www.physalia-courses.org/).

The course was held by **[Daniel Pass](https://github.com/passdan)** and the original repository of the course can be found [here](https://github.com/passdan/PracticalPythonProgrammingForBiologists).
